# Car-Number-Plate-Detection
THIS CODE IS TAKEN FROM https://circuitdigest.com/tutorial/vehicle-number-plate-detection-using-matlab-and-image-processing#
but if You Go There and See the Comments The Programmer Who Programmed this Code Doesn't Answer AnyOne.

So I Change the codes alittle bit.

The Most and Major Thing That Causes The Errors Was the imbinarize() Function on Plate Detection.m File.
So We Should Know that the imbinarize doesn't work on MATLAB 2015 and Lower Version.

You Can Fork Or Clone this Repo. To Your System And Use it.

!!!! JUST REMEMBER THAT YOU MUST RUN THE Plate Detection.m FILE AND DON'T MESS WITH THE FILES ;-) !!!!
